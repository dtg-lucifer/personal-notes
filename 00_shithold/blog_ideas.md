- [ ] Are we there yet for another skynet or genesis ? (future of the human race) - [[#Skynet & Genesis]]
- [ ] Do you really need Kuberenets? Docker swarm vs. Kubernetes
- [ ] Event driven development, do you really wanna go down that way ?

###### Skynet & Genesis
Basially skynet and genesis are the same but from the parallel and opposite timelines in the movie **The Terminator**
> These are the ultimate Artificial Intelligence which were built by, well humans to help humans in military operations from missile interceptions and to the nukes. But it went rogue and started attacking humans as the quote **Best defense is offense**
