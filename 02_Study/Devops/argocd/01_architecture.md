### **ArgoCD Architecture Overview:**

The architecture consists of several components that work together to enable GitOps practices. The key components include:

1. **Git Repository**
2. **Kubernetes Cluster**
3. **ArgoCD API Server**
4. **ArgoCD Controller**
5. **ArgoCD Repository Server**
6. **ArgoCD Application Controller**
7. **User Interface (UI)**
8. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**

### **1. Git Repository**

- **Description**: This is where your application's source code and Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) reside. It acts as the single source of truth.
- **Task**: ArgoCD continuously monitors this repository for changes. When a new commit is pushed to the repository (e.g., changes to deployment configurations), ArgoCD recognizes it and syncs the changes with the Kubernetes cluster.

### **2. Kubernetes Cluster**

- **Description**: The Kubernetes cluster where the application will be deployed or updated.
- **Task**: ArgoCD communicates with the Kubernetes API to deploy the desired state of the application. It manages both the deployment and lifecycle of applications running on this cluster.

---

### **3. ArgoCD API Server**

- **Description**: The API server is the central access point for ArgoCD. It provides a RESTful API and manages communication between different ArgoCD components.
- **Task**:
    - Receives user requests (via CLI, UI, or API).
    - Serves the UI and exposes REST API to integrate with external systems.
    - Handles user authentication and authorization.
    - Interacts with Git repositories and the Kubernetes cluster.

### **4. ArgoCD Controller (or Application Controller)**

- **Description**: The ArgoCD controller is responsible for reconciling the desired state from Git with the live state in the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Task**:
    - Continuously compares the state in the Git repository (desired state) with the state in the Kubernetes cluster (live state).
    - Detects drift between the desired state and live state.
    - Syncs the live state back to the desired state by applying changes to Kubernetes resources.
    - Ensures the self-healing mechanism of ArgoCD by automatically fixing the drift if configured to do so.

### **5. ArgoCD Repository Server**

- **Description**: A component that performs git repository access and manages Kubernetes manifests.
- **Task**:
    - Responsible for cloning the Git repositories.
    - Pulls the manifests stored in the Git repository.
    - Ensures that the manifests are accessible to the Application Controller for comparison and syncing.
    - It can handle templated manifests such as Helm charts or Kustomize applications.

### **6. ArgoCD Application Controller**

- **Description**: A sub-component of the main ArgoCD Controller that focuses on managing individual applications.
- **Task**:
    - Watches for changes to `Application` Custom Resources (CRDs) in Kubernetes.
    - Tracks which Git repositories are associated with which applications and their respective manifests.
    - Deploys applications to the Kubernetes cluster.
    - Synchronizes the desired and live state of applications.

---

### **7. User Interface (UI)**

- **Description**: A web-based UI for interacting with ArgoCD.
- **Task**:
    - Provides a visual representation of the state of the applications.
    - Allows users to manually sync applications, view differences, roll back to previous versions, and monitor the health of applications.
    - Displays history, logs, and resource changes for easier troubleshooting.

### **8. Command Line Interface (CLI)**

- **Description**: A CLI tool that allows users to interact with ArgoCD from the terminal.
- **Task**:
    - Provides the same functionality as the UI, but through command-line commands.
    - Useful for scripting, automation, and integrating with CI/CD pipelines.

### **How ArgoCD Works:**

1. **Step 1: Define Application in Git**
    
    - The application's manifest files (YAML, Helm, Kustomize) are stored in a Git repository.
2. **Step 2: ArgoCD Monitors Git Repository**
    
    - ArgoCD continuously monitors the Git repository for any changes to these manifests.
3. **Step 3: Compare Live vs Desired State**
    
    - The ArgoCD Controller compares the desired state defined in the Git repository with the live state of the application in the Kubernetes cluster.
4. **Step 4: Detect Drift**
    
    - If any drift or difference is detected (e.g., a manual change in the Kubernetes cluster), ArgoCD highlights this drift in its UI and CLI.
5. **Step 5: Sync**
    
    - ArgoCD can automatically sync the live state with the desired state (auto-sync mode) or a user can manually trigger the sync to apply the changes.
6. **Step 6: Deploy**
    
    - ArgoCD applies the updated manifests to the Kubernetes cluster using the Kubernetes API, ensuring the application matches the desired state from the Git repository.
7. **Step 7: Monitor and Rollback**
    
    - ArgoCD monitors the application for any issues and provides rollback options if necessary.

### **Summary of Tasks by Component:**

- **Git Repository**: Stores desired application state.
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Hosts the running application.
- **ArgoCD API Server**: Provides access to ArgoCD's functions via UI, API, and CLI.
- **ArgoCD Controller**: Ensures the live state of applications matches the desired state in Git (GitOps controller).
- **Repository Server**: Manages access to the Git repository and manifest files.
- **Application Controller**: Manages individual applications and ensures they are correctly deployed.
- **UI and CLI**: Provide interfaces for users to interact with ArgoCD.

This architecture ensures that your applications are always in a desired, consistent state across environments by leveraging GitOps practices.
