# *Number 1 (sudo password)*

Setting up SSH keys for Ansible to connect to remote servers and configuring root access for privilege escalation involves a few steps. Here’s a detailed guide:

### Setting Up SSH Keys

1. **Generate an SSH Key Pair**: On your local machine, generate an SSH key pair if you don’t already have one:
    
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```
    
    Follow the prompts to save the key pair in the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
    
2. **Copy the Public Key to the Remote Server**: Use `ssh-copy-id` to copy your public key to the remote server:
    
    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id your_user@your_server_ip
    ```
    
    This command will add your public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote server.
    
3. **Verify SSH Access**: Test the SSH connection to ensure that you can log in without a password:
    
    ```bash
    ssh your_user@your_server_ip
    ```
    

### Configuring Ansible to Use SSH Keys

1. **Inventory File**: Create an inventory file (e.g., `hosts.ini`) with the following content:
    
```ini
[webservers]
your_server_ip ansible_user=your_user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
    
2. **Playbook Example**: Create a simple playbook (e.g., `test-connection.yml`) to test the connection:
    
    ```yaml
    ---
    - name: Test connection
      hosts: webservers
      tasks:
        - name: Ping the server
          ping:
    ```
    
3. **Run the Playbook**: Execute the playbook to test the connection:
    
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini test-connection.yml
    ```
    

### Setting Up Root Access for Ansible

1. **Configure Sudo Access**: Ensure that your user has sudo privileges on the remote server. You can add the user to the sudoers file:
    
    ```bash
    sudo visudo
    ```
    
    Add the following line:
    
    ```plaintext
    your_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
    ```
    
2. **Using `become` in Playbooks**: Use the `become` directive in your playbooks to run tasks with root privileges. Here’s an example playbook to install Nginx:
    
    ```yaml
    ---
    - name: Install and start Nginx
      hosts: webservers
      become: yes
      tasks:
        - name: Update apt cache
          apt:
            update_cache: yes
    
        - name: Install Nginx
          apt:
            name: nginx
            state: present
    
        - name: Start Nginx service
          service:
            name: nginx
            state: started
            enabled: yes
    ```
    
3. **Running the Playbook with Sudo Password**: If you need to provide a sudo password, you can run the playbook with the `-K` option:
    
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini install-nginx.yml -K
    ```
    

[By following these steps, you should be able to set up SSH keys for Ansible and configure root access for running commands that require elevated privileges](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/connection_details.html)[1](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/connection_details.html)[2](https://dev.to/rimelek/ansible-playbook-and-ssh-keys-33bo)[3](https://hatchjs.com/ansible-add-ssh-key-to-authorized_keys/).

# *Number 2 (ssh passwordless)*

I understand that manually setting up SSH keys and configuring root access on hundreds of servers can be quite daunting. Here are some automated approaches to streamline this process:

### Using Ansible to Distribute SSH Keys and Configure Sudo Access

You can use Ansible itself to distribute SSH keys and configure sudo access on all your servers. Here’s a playbook to help you with that:

1. **Generate SSH Key Pair**: If you haven’t already, generate an SSH key pair on your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```
    
2. **Create a Playbook to Distribute SSH Keys**: Save the following content in a file named `setup-ssh.yml`.
    
    ```yaml
    ---
    - name: Distribute SSH keys and configure sudo access
      hosts: all
      become: yes
      vars:
        ansible_ssh_private_key_file: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        public_key: "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"
      tasks:
        - name: Ensure .ssh directory exists
          file:
            path: /home/{{ ansible_user }}/.ssh
            state: directory
            mode: '0700'
            owner: "{{ ansible_user }}"
            group: "{{ ansible_user }}"
    
        - name: Copy SSH public key to authorized_keys
          authorized_key:
            user: "{{ ansible_user }}"
            state: present
            key: "{{ public_key }}"
    
        - name: Configure sudoers file for passwordless sudo
          lineinfile:
            path: /etc/sudoers
            state: present
            regexp: '^{{ ansible_user }} ALL=\(ALL\) NOPASSWD: ALL'
            line: '{{ ansible_user }} ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'
            validate: 'visudo -cf %s'
    ```
    
3. **Create an Inventory File**: Save the following content in a file named `hosts.ini`.
    
    ```
    [all]
    server1 ansible_host=your_server1_ip ansible_user=your_user
    server2 ansible_host=your_server2_ip ansible_user=your_user
    ```
    
    Replace `your_server1_ip`, `your_server2_ip`, etc., with the IP addresses of your servers and `your_user` with the username you use to connect to the servers.
    
4. **Run the Playbook**: Execute the playbook with the following command:
    
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini setup-ssh.yml --ask-pass
    ```
    
    The `--ask-pass` option will prompt you for the SSH password for the initial connection.
