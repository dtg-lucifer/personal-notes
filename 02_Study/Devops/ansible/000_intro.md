# What is Ansible?

**Ansible** is an open-source IT automation tool that simplifies the management of systems, deployment of software, and orchestration of complex workflows. It is designed to be simple, powerful, and agentless, making it a popular choice for DevOps and IT professionals.

### How Ansible Works

1. **Agentless Architecture**: Ansible does not require any agents to be installed on the managed nodes. [It uses SSH (Secure Shell) for Linux/Unix systems and WinRM (Windows Remote Management) for Windows systems to communicate with the nodes](https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/)[1](https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/).
    
2. **Playbooks**: Ansible uses playbooks, which are written in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language), to define automation tasks. [Playbooks are human-readable and describe the desired state of the system](https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/)[2](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/introduction.html).
    
3. **Modules**: Ansible modules are small programs that perform specific tasks, such as installing software, managing services, or configuring network devices. [These modules are executed on the managed nodes and then removed once the task is completed](https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/)[3](https://petri.com/what-is-ansible/).
    
4. **Idempotence**: Ansible ensures that running the same playbook multiple times will not change the system if it is already in the desired state. [This property is known as idempotence](https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/)[2](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/introduction.html).
    
5. **Control Node and Managed Nodes**: Ansible is executed from a control node, which sends commands to the managed nodes. [The control node can be any machine with Ansible installed, and the managed nodes are the systems being automated](https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/)[1](https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/).
    

### Why Ansible is So Good

1. **Simplicity**: Ansibleâ€™s playbooks are written in YAML, which is easy to read and write. [This simplicity reduces the learning curve and makes it accessible to a wide range of users](https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/)[2](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/introduction.html).
    
2. [**Agentless**: Since Ansible does not require agents on the managed nodes, it reduces the overhead of managing additional software and simplifies the setup process](https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/)[1](https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/).
    
3. [**Flexibility**: Ansible can automate a wide range of tasks, from configuration management and application deployment to orchestration and cloud provisioning](https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/)[4](https://opensource.com/resources/what-ansible).
    
4. [**Scalability**: Ansible can manage a few servers to thousands of nodes, making it suitable for both small and large environments](https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/)[2](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/introduction.html).
    
5. **Community and Support**: Ansible has a large and active community, providing a wealth of resources, modules, and plugins. [Additionally, Red Hat offers enterprise support through the Ansible Automation Platform](https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/)[1](https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/).
