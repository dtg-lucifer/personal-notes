# What is a Web Server?

Whenever you open your browser, type a URL and then click enter. Basically, you are requesting the contents of that URL. Ever wondered where the content are? Yes, youâ€™re right those are contents placed on remote computers which, after accepting your request, send the contents of that URL back as a response.

Web Servers are computers that deliver the requested web pages. Every web server has an IP address and domain name.Â 
- AÂ **web server**Â is software that handles HTTP requests from clients (such as browsers) and serves web content (like HTML, CSS, and images).
- It listens on a specific port (usually 80 or 443 for HTTP and HTTPS, respectively) and responds to incoming requests.
- When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server, which then sends back the requested content.

# What is NGINX then ??
It is open-source software designed for maximum performance and stability. Letâ€™s see basically why we need it basically see how we can benefit from this.

- Originally created by Igor Sysoev in 2004, Nginx was designed to address the C10k problem (handling 10,000 concurrent connections efficiently).
- Over time, Nginx has become more versatile:
    - **Web Server**: Nginx serves static files (like images) and handles basic HTTP requests.
    - **Reverse Proxy**: It can distribute requests to multiple backend servers (like application servers or other web servers). See this - [[#How to host a Next.js app on Raspberry Pi with nginx]]
    - **Load Balancer**: Nginx balances traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability.
    - **HTTP Cache**: It stores frequently accessed content in memory to reduce load on backend servers.
- **How It Works Under the Hood**:
    - Nginx uses an asynchronous, event-driven model:
        - One master process controls multiple worker processes.
        - Requests are handled concurrently without blocking others.
        - Low memory usage and high concurrency.
    - Common features include reverse proxying, load balancing, FastCGI support, WebSockets, and TLS/SSL handling.
    - Nginx excels in scenarios with static content and high concurrent requests.
    - Notable users include Netflix, NASA, and WordPress.com .

Suppose we develop our application on Django or Node. All such frameworks have built-in development servers to host your project. But whenever someone tries to host that application on the production level with built-in development servers, youâ€™ll get a tough time handling all the requests while experiencing downtimes while just handling 30-40 concurrent requests.

Nginx is a dedicated web server that has solved efficiency issues and provided us with an optimum way to handle 1000s of requests concurrently.

# Web server for reverse proxy, caching, and load balancing.Â 

The reverse proxy accepts a request from a client, forwards the request to a server that can fulfill it, and returns the response from the server to the client.

Caching is a technique that stores a copy of a given resource and serves it back when requested. When a web cache has a requested resource in its store, it intercepts the request and returns its copy instead of re-downloading from the originating server.

A load balancer distributes the incoming client requests to a group of servers, in which it can handle concurrent requests without experiencing load on a particular server.

Other features of Nginx are as follows:

- It provides HTTP server capabilities.
- Designed to provide stability and maximum performance.
- Functions as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP).
- It uses an event-driven and non-threaded architecture to provide less CPU computation per request served.
- It provides scalability.
- Reduces wait time for the client.
- Upgrades can be done while Nginx is hosting a website without any downtime.

# Difference between nginx and apache web server
1. **Apache**:
    - **Web Server**: Apache is an open-source web server that has been around since 1999. Itâ€™s widely used and runs on Unix, Linux, Windows, and Solaris platforms.
    - **Dynamic Content**: Apache is excellent for serving dynamic content (like PHP scripts) and handling complex configurations.
    - **Architecture**: It follows a process-based model, creating a new thread for each request.
    - **Modules**: Apache supports dynamically loaded modules, which can make its configuration complex.
    - **Security**: While secure, its codebase is larger.
    - **Performance**: For static content, Apacheâ€™s performance is lower compared to Nginx.
    
1. **Nginx**:
    - **Web Server and More**: Nginx is a lightweight, high-performance web server. It also serves as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
    - **Static Files**: Nginx excels at serving static files (like images, CSS, and JS). Itâ€™s often used as a front-end proxy to backend services.
    - **Event-Driven Model**: Nginx uses an event-driven approach, handling multiple client requests efficiently.
    - **Security**: Nginx provides better security with a smaller codebase.
    - **Performance**: Nginxâ€™s performance for static content is significantly faster than Apache.
    - **Companies Using Nginx**: IBM, Google, GitLab, DuckDuckGo, and more.

In summary, Apache is versatile for dynamic content, while Nginx shines with static files and efficient event-driven processing.Â [Choose based on your specific use case! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-apache-and-nginx/)

# How to host a Next.js app on Raspberry Pi with nginx

Certainly! You can deploy your Next.js app on a Raspberry Pi using Nginx. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Nginx**: First, ensure that Nginx is installed on your Raspberry Pi. If itâ€™s not already installed, run the following commands:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nginx
    ```
    
2. **Clone Your Next.js App**: Clone your Next.js app repository to your Raspberry Pi using Git:
    
    ```bash
    git clone <your_app_repository_url>
    ```
    
3. **Install Dependencies and Build**: Navigate to your app directory and install its dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    cd <your_app_directory>
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
    
4. **Set Up PM2**: Install PM2, a process manager that keeps your app running in the background and restarts it if it crashes:
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g pm2
    pm2 start npm --name "your-app-name" -- start
    ```
    
5. **Configure Nginx**: Create an Nginx configuration file for your app (replace `your-app-name.com` with your domain):
    
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-app-name.com
    ```
    
    Inside the file, add the following code:
    
    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name your-domain-name.com www.your-domain-name.com;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Save the file, create a symbolic link, and restart Nginx:
    
    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-app-name.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```
    
6. **DNS Configuration**: Make sure your domain name points correctly to your Raspberry Pi.
    

Thatâ€™s it!
