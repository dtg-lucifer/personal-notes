To make your Raspberry Pi accessible from the internet, follow these steps:

1. **Find Your Public IP Address**:
    
    - Use a service like icanhazip.com to determine your external (public) IP address. This address represents your routerâ€™s external interface and is what others will use to access your Raspberry Pi.
2. **Port Forwarding**:
    
    - Log in to your routerâ€™s web interface.
    - Navigate to the port forwarding settings.
    - Add a port forward rule that redirects traffic from your public IP address and port 80 (HTTP) to your Raspberry Piâ€™s local IP address and port 80.
    - Ensure your Raspberry Pi has a static local IP address (you can set this up in your router or on the Pi itself).
3. **Dynamic DNS (Optional)**:
    
    - If your ISP assigns a dynamic IP address (which changes periodically), consider using a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service.
    - Services like noip.com allow you to create a hostname (e.g., `youraccount.no-ip.org`) that always points to your Raspberry Pi, regardless of its changing IP address.
4. **Test Access**:
    
    - Access your Raspberry Pi using your public IP address from a different network (e.g., a mobile hotspot or a friendâ€™s network).
    - Make sure your web server (e.g., Nginx) is running and properly configured.

Remember to secure your Raspberry Pi by setting up proper authentication and firewall rules.
