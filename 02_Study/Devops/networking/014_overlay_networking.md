Overlay networking is a method of creating a virtual network on top of an existing physical network. It involves the encapsulation of packets or frames within another set of protocols, allowing multiple separate virtual networks to coexist on the same underlying infrastructure. This is often used to simplify network management, improve scalability, and facilitate advanced features such as:

- **Isolation**: Different virtual networks can operate independently on the same physical network, which is useful in multi-tenant environments like cloud services.
- **Network Virtualization**: Virtual machines or containers across different physical machines can appear to be on the same local network, regardless of the underlying physical topology.
- **Security**: Overlays can help isolate traffic and enforce security policies between different networks or users.
  
Overlay networks are often used in environments such as:
- **Cloud computing** (e.g., using technologies like Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN), GRE tunnels, or SDN overlays).
- **Software-defined networking (SDN)** to decouple network services from physical hardware.
- **P2P networks** (like BitTorrent or Tor) that form networks over the internet independently of the physical connections.

In containerized environments like Kubernetes, overlay networks are commonly used to enable communication between containers across different nodes in a cluster (e.g., with CNI plugins like Flannel or Calico).
