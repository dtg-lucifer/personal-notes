# What is a topology
Network topology refers to how various nodes, devices, and connections on your network areÂ **physically or logically arranged**Â in relation to each other. Think of your network as a city, and the topology as the road map. Just as there are many ways to arrange and maintain a cityâ€”such as making sure the avenues and boulevards can facilitate passage between the parts of town getting the most trafficâ€”there are several ways to arrange a network.Â [Each has advantages and disadvantages, and depending on the needs of your company, certain arrangements can give you a greater degree of connectivity and security](https://www.dnsstuff.com/what-is-network-topology)[1](https://www.dnsstuff.com/what-is-network-topology).

In networking, there areÂ **two approaches**Â to network topology:

1. **Physical network topology**: This refers to theÂ **physical connections and interconnections**Â between nodes and the networkâ€”the wires, cables, and so forth.
2. **Logical network topology**: A more abstract and strategic view, it refers to theÂ **conceptual understanding**Â of how and why the network is arranged the way it is, and how data moves through it.

The layout of your network is important for several reasons. Above all, it plays an essential role in how well your network functions.Â [Choosing the right topology for your companyâ€™s operational model can increase performance while making it easier to locate faults, troubleshoot errors, and more effectively allocate resources across the network to ensure optimal network health](https://www.dnsstuff.com/what-is-network-topology)[1](https://www.dnsstuff.com/what-is-network-topology). If you have any specific questions about network topologies or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š

# Types of Topologies

### 1. Bus topology:
In this type of topology, all the nodes or the computers are connected to a centralized network cable known as **BACKBONE** or the **TRUNK**, via which all the networking happens
### 2. Ring:
Nodes are connected to each other with a single network cable but there is a draw back because the nodes are connected as a form of a ring which makes the networking slow in some times, suppose if we arranges computers in the order of **A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> A -> B ......** and so on like this. So here is the thing, if we need to pass the data from the computer A to computer E then we cant directly send that to E, We have to send it via the mediatory computers such as B C D then it will get to the E computer.
### 3. Star
In this kind of topology, there is a central hub to which every one of the computers are connected, so take the previous example from [[#2. Ring]], and if we want to send the data from A to E then the computer A will send the data to the central HUB then the hub will send the data to the E computer.

### 4. Tree
Combination of bus and star topology. 
**Many star topologies connected with a bus topology**

### 5. Mesh topology
In this topology every single computer is connected to each other with the connection. It is kind of graph data structure in the DSA.
