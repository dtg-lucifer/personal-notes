# What is *Terraform* and why is  *Terraform* ?

Terraform is an open-source **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool developed by HashiCorp. [It allows you to define and manage infrastructure using configuration files written in the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro)[1](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-terraform/). Here are some key points about Terraform:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: You can define your infrastructure in code, which makes it easy to version, reuse, and share. This approach also helps in maintaining consistency across different environments.
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Terraform supports multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and many others. [It can also manage on-premises resources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro)[1](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-terraform/).
- **Declarative Language**: You specify the desired state of your infrastructure, and Terraform figures out how to achieve that state. [This simplifies the process of managing complex infrastructure](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-terraform/).
- **Providers and Modules**: Terraform uses providers to interact with different platforms and services. There are thousands of providers available, and you can also create your own. [Modules allow you to group resources and reuse configurations](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro)[1](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-terraform/).
- **Lifecycle Management**: Terraform manages the lifecycle of your infrastructure, including creation, updates, and deletion. [It generates an execution plan before making any changes, ensuring you know exactly what will happen](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro)[1](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro).

# Provisioning vs Configuration management

Provisioning and configuration management are two essential processes in managing IT infrastructure, but they serve different purposes and involve distinct activities:

### Provisioning

- **Definition**: Provisioning is the process of setting up the necessary infrastructure to support new equipment, applications, or services. [This includes creating and configuring resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networks](https://devops.com/provisioning-vs-configuration/)[1](https://devops.com/provisioning-vs-configuration/)[2](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/why-configuration-management-and-provisioning-are-different).
- **Purpose**: The primary goal is to make resources available and operational. [This is often the first step in deploying new systems or applications](https://devops.com/provisioning-vs-configuration/)[3](https://grammarbeast.com/provisioning-vs-configuration/).
- [**Examples**: Creating a new virtual machine on a cloud platform, setting up a new database instance, or provisioning network resources](https://devops.com/provisioning-vs-configuration/)[4](https://www.chef.io/blog/infrastructure-provisioning-vs-configuration-management-vs-configuration-orchestration-how-iac-makes-them-all-better).

### Configuration Management

- **Definition**: Configuration management involves the detailed setup and maintenance of the provisioned resources to ensure they meet specific requirements and function correctly. [This includes managing software installations, system settings, and configurations](https://devops.com/provisioning-vs-configuration/)[2](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/why-configuration-management-and-provisioning-are-different)[4](https://www.chef.io/blog/infrastructure-provisioning-vs-configuration-management-vs-configuration-orchestration-how-iac-makes-them-all-better).
- [**Purpose**: The main objective is to maintain consistency and control over the configuration of systems and services, ensuring they operate as intended](https://devops.com/provisioning-vs-configuration/)[3](https://grammarbeast.com/provisioning-vs-configuration/).
- [**Examples**: Installing and configuring web servers, applying security patches, and managing configuration files for applications](https://devops.com/provisioning-vs-configuration/)[4](https://www.chef.io/blog/infrastructure-provisioning-vs-configuration-management-vs-configuration-orchestration-how-iac-makes-them-all-better).

### Key Differences

- [**Scope**: Provisioning focuses on creating and making resources available, while configuration management deals with the ongoing management and customization of those resources](https://devops.com/provisioning-vs-configuration/)[2](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/why-configuration-management-and-provisioning-are-different)[3](https://grammarbeast.com/provisioning-vs-configuration/).
- [**Timing**: Provisioning is typically a one-time setup process, whereas configuration management is an ongoing activity that ensures systems remain in the desired state](https://devops.com/provisioning-vs-configuration/)[1](https://devops.com/provisioning-vs-configuration/)[4](https://www.chef.io/blog/infrastructure-provisioning-vs-configuration-management-vs-configuration-orchestration-how-iac-makes-them-all-better).

# What is provisionaers in *Terraform*?

In Terraform, **provisioners** are used to execute scripts or commands on a local or remote machine as part of the resource creation or destruction process. [They allow you to perform additional configuration and setup tasks that can’t be accomplished with Terraform’s declarative syntax alone](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax)[1](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax)[2](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/remote-exec). Here are some key points about provisioners:

### Types of Provisioners

1. **local-exec**: Executes a command on the machine running Terraform.
2. **remote-exec**: Executes a command on a remote resource after it is created. [This can be used to run configuration management tools, bootstrap into a cluster, etc](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax)[2](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/remote-exec).

### Common Use Cases

- **Bootstrapping**: Installing software or configuring a server after it has been created.
- **Configuration Management**: Running tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet to manage the configuration of the resource.
- **File Transfer**: Copying files to the remote resource.

### Example

Here’s a simple example of using the `remote-exec` provisioner to run a script on a newly created AWS instance:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  connection {
    type     = "ssh"
    user     = "ec2-user"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
    host     = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get update",
      "sudo apt-get install -y nginx"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Important Considerations

- [**Last Resort**: Provisioners should be used as a last resort because they can introduce complexity and uncertainty into your Terraform configurations](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax)[1](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax)[2](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/remote-exec).
- [**Alternatives**: For many tasks, there are better alternatives such as cloud-init, user data scripts, or using configuration management tools directly](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax)[1](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax).
