In Terraform, **state** is a critical concept that helps manage your infrastructure. Here’s a breakdown of what it is, where it’s stored, and how it boosts productivity:

### What is Terraform State?

Terraform state is a file that keeps track of the infrastructure resources defined in your configuration. It maps these resources to real-world objects, allowing Terraform to manage and update them efficiently. The state file contains metadata and resource IDs, which Terraform uses to determine the current state of your infrastructure and what changes need to be applied.

### Where is Terraform State Stored?

[By default, Terraform stores the state in a local file named `terraform.tfstate` in the root directory of your project](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state)[1](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state). However, for better collaboration and security, it’s recommended to store the state remotely. Common remote storage options include:

- **Amazon S3**
- **Azure Blob Storage**
- **Google Cloud Storage**
- **HashiCorp Consul**
- **Terraform Cloud** (HCP Terraform)

### How Does Terraform State Boost Productivity?

1. **Consistency and Accuracy**: The state file ensures that Terraform has an accurate representation of your infrastructure, reducing the risk of discrepancies between your configuration and the actual resources.
2. **Efficient Planning**: By comparing the current state with the desired state defined in your configuration, Terraform can generate precise execution plans, showing exactly what changes will be made.
3. **Collaboration**: Remote state storage allows multiple team members to work on the same infrastructure without conflicts, as the state file is shared and updated centrally.
4. **Automation**: State files enable automation tools and CI/CD pipelines to manage infrastructure changes consistently and reliably.
5. **Resource Tracking**: Terraform state helps track resource dependencies and relationships, making it easier to manage complex infrastructures.
