### Best Tools for Tracing Issues with Kubernetes Pods

1. **Prometheus & Grafana**
    
    - **Prometheus**: A powerful monitoring and alerting toolkit that collects metrics from various sources, including Kubernetes Pods.
    - [**Grafana**: A visualization tool that integrates with Prometheus to create dashboards for monitoring metrics](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/kubernetes-monitoring/)[1](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/kubernetes-monitoring/).
2. **Jaeger**
    
    - A distributed tracing system that helps monitor and troubleshoot microservices-based applications. [It provides insights into latency issues and service dependencies](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/kubernetes-monitoring/)[2](https://sematext.com/blog/kubernetes-monitoring-tools/).
3. **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**
    
    - **Elasticsearch**: A search engine that stores logs and metrics.
    - **Logstash**: A data processing pipeline that ingests logs and metrics.
    - [**Kibana**: A visualization tool for Elasticsearch data, useful for analyzing logs and metrics](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/kubernetes-monitoring/)[3](https://www.tigera.io/learn/guides/kubernetes-monitoring/).
4. **Fluentd**
    
    - [A unified logging layer that collects logs from various sources and forwards them to different destinations, such as Elasticsearch](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/kubernetes-monitoring/)[3](https://www.tigera.io/learn/guides/kubernetes-monitoring/).
5. **Kube-state-metrics**
    
    - [Exposes Kubernetes cluster state metrics, which can be used to monitor the health and performance of Kubernetes resources](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/kubernetes-monitoring/)[4](https://komodor.com/learn/kubernetes-troubleshooting-the-complete-guide/).
6. **Kubewatch**
    
    - [A Kubernetes watcher that publishes notifications to Slack or other channels when there are changes in the cluster, helping to quickly identify issues](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/kubernetes-monitoring/)[4](https://komodor.com/learn/kubernetes-troubleshooting-the-complete-guide/).

### CNCF Projects Used in Production by Fortune 50 Companies

Many CNCF projects are widely adopted in production environments by Fortune 50 companies. Some of the most commonly used projects include:
