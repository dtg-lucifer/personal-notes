# What is Kubespray?
Kubespray is an open-source project that simplifies the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters. [It leverages Ansible playbooks to automate the setup process, making it easier to create and maintain highly available Kubernetes clusters across various environments, including cloud providers like AWS, GCE, Azure, and on-premises setups](https://kubespray.io/)[1](https://kubespray.io/)[2](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/kubespray-deploy-kubernetes).

### How Kubespray Works

1. **Ansible Playbooks**: Kubespray uses Ansible, a powerful automation tool, to define and execute the steps needed to set up a Kubernetes cluster. [These playbooks handle tasks such as installing necessary packages, configuring network settings, and deploying Kubernetes components](https://kubespray.io/)[1](https://kubespray.io/)[2](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/kubespray-deploy-kubernetes).
    
2. **Inventory Management**: You define the nodes in your cluster using an inventory file. [This file lists all the machines and their roles (e.g., master, worker) in the cluster](https://kubespray.io/)[1](https://kubespray.io/).
    
3. **Customization**: Kubespray allows for extensive customization. [You can choose different network plugins, container runtimes, and other components to tailor the cluster to your specific needs](https://kubespray.io/)[2](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/kubespray-deploy-kubernetes)[3](https://upcloud.com/resources/tutorials/deploy-kubernetes-using-kubespray).
    
4. [**High Availability**: It supports the deployment of highly available clusters, ensuring that your Kubernetes setup can handle failures and continue to operate smoothly](https://kubespray.io/)[3](https://upcloud.com/resources/tutorials/deploy-kubernetes-using-kubespray).
    
5. [**Multi-Environment Support**: Kubespray can deploy clusters on various platforms, including bare metal, virtual machines, and cloud environments, providing flexibility in where and how you run your Kubernetes clusters](https://kubespray.io/)[1](https://kubespray.io/)[3](https://upcloud.com/resources/tutorials/deploy-kubernetes-using-kubespray).
    

### Steps to Deploy a Cluster with Kubespray

1. **Prepare the Environment**: Install Ansible and clone the Kubespray repository.
2. **Configure Inventory**: Create and customize your inventory file to define the nodes in your cluster.
3. **Run Playbooks**: Execute the Ansible playbooks to set up the Kubernetes cluster. [This involves running commands like `ansible-playbook -i inventory/mycluster/hosts.yaml cluster.yml`](https://kubespray.io/)[1](https://kubespray.io/).
