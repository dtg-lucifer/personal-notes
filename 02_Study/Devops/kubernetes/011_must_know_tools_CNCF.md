# What are the must know tools from *CNCF* project?

To become a professional DevOps engineer, itâ€™s essential to be familiar with several key projects from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Here are some of the most important ones:

### Graduated Projects

1. **Kubernetes**: The cornerstone of container orchestration, Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
2. **Prometheus**: A powerful monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability.
3. **Envoy**: A high-performance, open-source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications.
4. **Fluentd**: A unified logging layer that allows you to collect, process, and ship logs from various sources.
5. **Helm**: A package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes clusters.

### Incubating Projects

1. **Argo**: A set of tools for running and managing Kubernetes-native workflows, applications, and events.
2. **Backstage**: An open platform for building developer portals, helping to manage and streamline developer workflows.
3. **KubeEdge**: Extends Kubernetes capabilities to edge computing, enabling deployment and management of applications at the edge.
4. **OpenTelemetry**: Provides a set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to enable observability (tracing, metrics, and logs) in cloud-native applications.
5. **Thanos**: A highly available Prometheus setup with long-term storage capabilities.

### Additional Recommendations

- **Tekton**: A powerful and flexible Kubernetes-native open-source framework for creating CI/CD systems.
- **Harbor**: An open-source container image registry that secures images with role-based access control, scans images for vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted.
- **Linkerd**: A lightweight service mesh for Kubernetes, providing observability, reliability, and security for microservices.
