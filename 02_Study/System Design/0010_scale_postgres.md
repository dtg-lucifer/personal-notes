Scaling PostgreSQL on Kubernetes with sharding, replication, and connection pooling (using PgBouncer) involves multiple steps and careful planning. Here's a detailed breakdown of how to achieve this for large-scale setups like Discord's:

### 1. **Sharding PostgreSQL on Kubernetes**

PostgreSQL doesn't natively support automatic sharding, but you can achieve sharding with these approaches:

#### A. **Manual Sharding:**
   - Split your data across multiple PostgreSQL instances based on a shard key (e.g., user_id, region).
   - Each shard is an independent database, responsible for a subset of data.
   - Your application is responsible for routing queries to the correct shard.

#### B. **Using Citus for Sharding (PostgreSQL extension)**:
   - **Citus** extends PostgreSQL by adding distributed table functionality. It allows for sharding tables across multiple nodes and parallelizing queries across shards.
   - To use Citus on Kubernetes, you can deploy a Citus cluster, where worker nodes handle individual shards, and a coordinator node routes queries.

   - **Steps**:
     1. **Deploy Citus**: Use the official Citus Docker image or Helm chart to deploy a coordinator and worker nodes in Kubernetes.
     2. **Shard Tables**: Use `create_distributed_table()` to shard the data. For example:
        ```sql
        SELECT create_distributed_table('my_table', 'shard_key');
        ```
     3. **Application Sharding Logic**: Ensure that your application is aware of the sharding and routes queries correctly.

### 2. **Replication for High Availability and Scaling Reads**

PostgreSQL supports replication through **streaming replication**.

#### A. **Streaming Replication in Kubernetes**:
   - In streaming replication, the primary (master) node sends write-ahead logs (WAL) to the replicas (read-only replicas).
   - You can achieve this by deploying multiple instances of PostgreSQL with replication enabled.

   - **Steps**:
     1. **Deploy Primary and Replica Pods**:
        - Use **StatefulSets** in Kubernetes to deploy your PostgreSQL instances. StatefulSets help maintain persistent storage for your database.
     2. **Configure Replication**:
        - On the **primary** instance, enable replication in `postgresql.conf`:
          ```bash
          wal_level = replica
          max_wal_senders = 10
          archive_mode = on
          archive_command = 'cp %p /var/lib/postgresql/wal_archive/%f'
          ```
        - Configure the **replicas** to pull data from the primary instance:
          ```bash
          standby_mode = 'on'
          primary_conninfo = 'host=primary_ip port=5432 user=replicator password=replica_password'
          ```
     3. **Automate Failover**: Use **Patroni** or **Stolon** to manage failover and replication in Kubernetes. These tools handle replication, failover, and scaling of PostgreSQL in containerized environments.

   #### B. **Conflict Resolution in Multi-Master Replication**:
   - If you need **multi-master replication** (where any node can accept writes), you can use **Postgres-BDR** (Bi-Directional Replication) or **Pglogical**.
   - These extensions allow replication between nodes in a multi-master setup, and you’ll need to define conflict resolution strategies (e.g., last-write-wins, custom logic).

### 3. **Connection Pooling with PgBouncer**

When scaling a large PostgreSQL cluster, connection pooling is essential to manage the number of active database connections efficiently.

#### A. **PgBouncer Setup**:
   - PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL. It handles a large number of client connections by reusing existing ones, reducing the load on the database.

   - **Steps**:
     1. **Deploy PgBouncer in Kubernetes**:
        - You can deploy PgBouncer as a **sidecar** in the same pod as your application, or as a **separate service** to manage connections for multiple apps.
        - Use the official **PgBouncer Docker image** and create a deployment for PgBouncer in Kubernetes.
        - Example **pgbouncer.ini** configuration:
          ```hosts
          [databases]
          mydb = host=postgresql-primary-service port=5432 dbname=mydb

          [pgbouncer]
          listen_addr = 0.0.0.0
          listen_port = 6432
          max_client_conn = 1000
          default_pool_size = 20
          log_connections = 1
          log_disconnections = 1
          auth_type = md5
          auth_file = /etc/pgbouncer/users.txt
          ```

     2. **Configure PostgreSQL Connections**:
        - Update your application’s database connection settings to use PgBouncer. Instead of connecting directly to PostgreSQL, connect to PgBouncer's IP/hostname:
          ```bash
          DB_HOST=pgbouncer-service
          DB_PORT=6432
          ```

     3. **Scaling PgBouncer**:
        - You can deploy multiple PgBouncer instances and load balance across them using Kubernetes **Services** or an **Ingress** controller.

### 4. **Handling Discord-like Scale**

Discord handles massive amounts of data and traffic, so to reach that level of scale with PostgreSQL, you need:

#### A. **High Availability (HA) and Fault Tolerance**:
   - Use **Kubernetes operators** like **Patroni** or **Crunchy PostgreSQL** to automate deployment, failover, and replication management. These operators simplify HA management in a Kubernetes environment.

#### B. **Horizontal Scaling with Sharding and Replication**:
   - Scale horizontally with sharding (via **Citus** or manual sharding).
   - Combine sharding with replication: Replicate each shard to ensure data redundancy and high availability.

#### C. **Connection Pooling**:
   - Scale PgBouncer horizontally to handle massive connection loads, allowing for thousands of concurrent connections.

#### D. **Monitoring and Performance Tuning**:
   - **Monitor**: Use tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring PostgreSQL performance, replication lag, and PgBouncer pool utilization.
   - **Optimize Queries**: Ensure indexes and proper partitioning to avoid performance bottlenecks.
   - **Tuning PostgreSQL**: Optimize settings like `work_mem`, `shared_buffers`, and `max_connections` for better performance.

### Example Architecture Flow:
1. **Kubernetes Cluster** with StatefulSets managing:
   - **Sharded PostgreSQL instances** using Citus or manual sharding.
   - **Primary-Replica setup** for each shard (streaming replication).
   - **PgBouncer** instances to manage connections efficiently.

2. **Patroni/Stolon** or **PostgreSQL Operator** manages:
   - Replication, failover, and automated scaling of PostgreSQL instances.

3. **Application** connects through **PgBouncer** to:
   - The appropriate shard or replica based on the sharding key and read/write requirements.

This setup ensures that you can handle both the massive **read** traffic through replication and the **write** traffic with sharding, while managing connections efficiently with PgBouncer.
