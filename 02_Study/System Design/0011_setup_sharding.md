To implement **application-level sharding logic** for PostgreSQL, your application needs to be aware of which shard a particular piece of data belongs to and route queries accordingly. Here's how you can set it up step by step:

### 1. **Design Your Shard Key**
   - The **shard key** is a field in your data that determines which shard a particular record will be stored in.
   - Choose a field that has high cardinality (e.g., `user_id`, `region_id`, etc.) and will evenly distribute the data across all shards.
   - For example, if you shard based on `user_id`, every time the application performs an operation involving a specific user, it will route the query to the appropriate shard.

### 2. **Set Up a Shard Mapping in Your Application**
   - You’ll need a mapping between each shard and the database instance it resides on. This can be done using a **consistent hashing algorithm**, a lookup table, or a configuration file.
   
   - **Example 1: Using a Hashing Algorithm**:
     You can use a hashing function (e.g., `MOD(user_id, number_of_shards)`) to calculate the shard where data should be stored:
     ```python
     def get_shard(user_id, num_shards):
         return user_id % num_shards
     ```
     For example, with 4 shards:
     - User with ID `1001` goes to shard `1001 % 4 = 1`
     - User with ID `1002` goes to shard `1002 % 4 = 2`

   - **Example 2: Using a Lookup Table**:
     If you don’t want to use a hash, you can use a lookup table that maps specific ranges of `user_id` to database connections:
     ```python
     SHARD_MAP = {
         "shard_1": "postgresql://shard1-host:5432/db",
         "shard_2": "postgresql://shard2-host:5432/db",
         "shard_3": "postgresql://shard3-host:5432/db"
     }

     def get_shard(user_id):
         if 1 <= user_id <= 1000:
             return SHARD_MAP["shard_1"]
         elif 1001 <= user_id <= 2000:
             return SHARD_MAP["shard_2"]
         else:
             return SHARD_MAP["shard_3"]
     ```

### 3. **Query Routing**
   - Based on the shard key, the application routes queries to the correct PostgreSQL instance (shard).
   - In each query, you need to first determine the correct shard based on the user or record you are interacting with.
   
   - **Example in Python**:
     ```python
     import psycopg2

     def connect_to_shard(shard_uri):
         conn = psycopg2.connect(shard_uri)
         return conn

     def fetch_user_data(user_id):
         shard_uri = get_shard(user_id)
         conn = connect_to_shard(shard_uri)
         cursor = conn.cursor()
         cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = %s", (user_id,))
         user_data = cursor.fetchone()
         conn.close()
         return user_data
     ```

   - **For Writes**:
     When inserting or updating data, use the same logic to identify the shard and route the query:
     ```python
     def insert_user(user_id, name, email):
         shard_uri = get_shard(user_id)
         conn = connect_to_shard(shard_uri)
         cursor = conn.cursor()
         cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (user_id, name, email) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)", (user_id, name, email))
         conn.commit()
         conn.close()
     ```

### 4. **Handling Failures and Fallbacks**
   - **Replication**: In a replicated setup, you may need to route **read queries** to replicas and **write queries** to the primary database.
   - You can maintain a list of primary and replica URIs for each shard and write logic to fallback to replicas when needed:
     ```python
     SHARD_MAP = {
         "shard_1": {
             "primary": "postgresql://primary-shard1:5432/db",
             "replica": "postgresql://replica-shard1:5432/db"
         },
         "shard_2": {
             "primary": "postgresql://primary-shard2:5432/db",
             "replica": "postgresql://replica-shard2:5432/db"
         }
     }

     def get_primary_shard(user_id):
         # Logic to return the primary shard
         return SHARD_MAP[get_shard_name(user_id)]["primary"]

     def get_replica_shard(user_id):
         # Logic to return the replica shard
         return SHARD_MAP[get_shard_name(user_id)]["replica"]
     ```

### 5. **Scaling Shards**
   - Initially, you may have a small number of shards, but as your database grows, you might need to add more shards.
   - In such cases, implement **re-sharding**:
     1. Update the shard map or hash function.
     2. Migrate existing data from old shards to new ones.
     3. Update your application to route queries based on the new shard logic.

### 6. **Distributed Transactions (If Needed)**
   - If your application needs to execute transactions that span multiple shards, you need to implement distributed transactions using **two-phase commit (2PC)**.
   - Tools like **PostgreSQL’s `pg_partman`** can help manage partitioning/sharding and distribution logic.
   
   However, distributed transactions can add complexity and overhead, so try to avoid cross-shard operations if possible by keeping your data model simple.

### 7. **Using Middleware (Optional)**
   - If the application code becomes complex with manual sharding logic, you can use a **middleware layer** or **ORM** that handles sharding. Libraries like **SQLAlchemy** support sharding at the ORM level:
     ```python
     from sqlalchemy import create_engine
     from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

     engine_1 = create_engine('postgresql://shard1-host/db')
     engine_2 = create_engine('postgresql://shard2-host/db')

     Session = sessionmaker()

     def get_engine_for_user(user_id):
         shard = user_id % 2
         if shard == 0:
             return engine_1
         else:
             return engine_2

     def get_user(user_id):
         engine = get_engine_for_user(user_id)
         session = Session(bind=engine)
         return session.query(User).filter_by(user_id=user_id).first()
     ```

### 8. **Testing the Sharding Logic**
   - Run load tests to ensure your sharding logic is correctly distributing load across shards.
   - Use test cases to verify that data routing is working as expected and check if replication and failover mechanisms are functioning.

### 9. **Monitoring and Management**
   - Use tools like **pg_stat_activity** to monitor active queries on each shard.
   - Set up **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to track performance metrics, replication lag, and database health.

---

### Example Workflow:
1. User logs in → App checks `user_id` → Shard key used to route query to correct PostgreSQL instance.
2. Writes are sent to the primary node of the shard, and reads are distributed between replicas.
3. PgBouncer handles connection pooling, optimizing the database connections and ensuring that the number of active connections stays manageable.

By implementing this application-aware sharding, your database will scale horizontally, allowing you to handle increasing loads without overwhelming a single PostgreSQL instance.
