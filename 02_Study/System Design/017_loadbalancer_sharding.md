### Load Balancer Sharding

Load balancer sharding is a technique where the load balancer itself is divided or "sharded" to distribute the traffic among multiple load balancers based on certain criteria, such as user ID, geographical location, or a hash of some unique identifier (like a session ID). This way, different shards (load balancers) handle specific sets of traffic, reducing the load on a single balancer and improving scalability, efficiency, and fault tolerance.

Key benefits of load balancer sharding:
- **Scalability**: By distributing the traffic across different load balancers, you avoid overwhelming a single load balancer, making it easier to handle large-scale systems.
- **Fault Tolerance**: If one load balancer fails, only a specific shard of traffic is affected, minimizing the impact.
- **Localized Optimization**: Sharding allows you to optimize the load balancers based on the specific shard's needs (e.g., one shard might serve premium users with lower latency, while others serve general users).

### Project Hulk by Hotstar

Hotstar’s **Project Hulk** was designed to manage the unprecedented traffic spikes they encountered, especially during live events like the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches. Hotstar’s platform needed to scale to millions of concurrent users (peaking over 25 million concurrent users during some matches). To achieve this, they implemented several techniques, including **load balancer sharding**.

Here’s how Hotstar used **load balancer sharding** in Project Hulk:

1. **Shard by User ID**: Hotstar implemented a strategy where traffic was routed based on user IDs. This meant that users with a particular range of IDs would be assigned to specific load balancers, distributing the incoming traffic among various balancers.
   
2. **Edge Load Balancers**: They deployed multiple edge load balancers across different geographical regions. The users were automatically routed to the nearest edge load balancer based on their location, ensuring low latency.

3. **Dynamic Scaling**: The architecture was designed to dynamically scale up resources, including the number of load balancer shards, as traffic increased. This prevented any single balancer from being overwhelmed.

4. **Pre-sharding**: They pre-sharded the backend infrastructure, so every user would be directed to a specific backend instance even before the load balancer received the request. This allowed them to handle massive concurrent user counts without bottlenecking at any single point.

5. **Event-driven Architecture (EDA)**: Hotstar used event-driven principles to ensure that their system could process requests asynchronously and handle surges efficiently. This reduced the load on the load balancers and allowed them to serve requests faster.

The combination of **load balancer sharding**, **geo-distributed edge nodes**, and **dynamic scaling** helped Hotstar maintain uptime and provide a seamless viewing experience, even under heavy load.
