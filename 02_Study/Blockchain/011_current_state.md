## **1. Current Blockchain Sizes**

- **Bitcoin**:
    - The blockchain size exceeds **500 GB** as of early 2025.
    - A new block is added approximately every 10 minutes.
- **Ethereum**:
    - The Ethereum state (full chain including all accounts, contracts, etc.) grows even faster, with storage exceeding **1 TB** in some configurations.

## **2. Techniques to Manage Growing Storage**

### **A. Pruning**

- Nodes can prune older data to reduce their storage burden:
    - **Bitcoin**:
        - Pruned nodes validate the blockchain fully but discard older transaction data, keeping only essential headers and the UTXO set.
        - This reduces storage requirements to under **10 GB** for lightweight nodes.
    - **Ethereum**:
        - Pruned nodes discard older states but keep the necessary "state root" for validation.

### **B. Light Nodes (SPV)**

- Light nodes or Simple Payment Verification (SPV) nodes store only block headers.
    - Headers are tiny (80 bytes for Bitcoin).
    - Light nodes rely on full nodes for detailed transaction data but can still validate their own transactions using Merkle proofs.

### **C. State Rent (Ethereum Proposal)**

- Ethereum researchers have proposed **state rent**, where inactive accounts or contracts must pay fees to remain in the blockchain state.
    - Accounts/contracts without rent payment are moved to archival storage or removed.

## **3. Archival Nodes vs. Regular Nodes**

- **Archival Nodes**:
    - Store the full blockchain history for research, development, or blockchain explorers.
    - These nodes require significant storage and are often run by institutions or enthusiasts.
- **Regular Nodes**:
    - Only store essential data (current state, UTXO set, recent blocks).
    - Designed for efficient operation with manageable storage.

## **4. Offloading Data Growth**

### **Layer 2 Solutions**

- Many transactions can be processed off-chain to reduce the load on the main blockchain:
    - **Bitcoin**: Lightning Network processes microtransactions off-chain and settles periodically on-chain.
    - **Ethereum**: Rollups like Optimistic Rollups and zkRollups aggregate many transactions and post proofs to the main chain.

### **Sharding (Ethereum)**

- Ethereum's transition to **Ethereum 2.0** introduces sharding:
    - The blockchain is split into smaller pieces ("shards"), each storing a subset of the data.
    - Nodes only manage data for specific shards, significantly reducing individual storage needs.

---

## **5. Data Retrieval and Redundancy**

- Blockchain data is **highly redundant**:
    - Thousands of nodes store overlapping data, ensuring fault tolerance.
- When you query data (like transactions), nodes aggregate data efficiently using:
    - **Indexes** (precomputed data mappings for faster lookup).
    - **Caching** (storing frequently accessed data in memory).

---

## **6. Incentives for Data Storage**

- Miners/validators and node operators are incentivized with rewards (block rewards, transaction fees).
- Nodes that prune or run light setups still contribute to the network without bearing the full storage burden.

---

## **The Key to Scalability**

Blockchain networks aren't truly "unlimited" in storage but manage growth by:

- Delegating responsibility across different node types.
- Implementing efficient data structures and compression.
- Encouraging off-chain scaling to reduce the mainchain's load.
