### **1. Merkle Trees: Efficient Data Verification**

Merkle trees are fundamental to blockchains for **data integrity and quick verification**.

#### **Structure**

- Transactions are hashed and arranged in a tree-like structure.
- Each leaf is a hash of a transaction, and parent nodes combine and hash their child nodes.
- The root of the tree, the **Merkle root**, summarizes all transactions in a block and is stored in the block header.

#### **Use Cases**

1. **Efficient Proofs**:
    - Light nodes use **Merkle proofs** to verify a transaction's inclusion without downloading the full block.
2. **Tamper Detection**:
    - Changing any transaction changes its hash, propagating up the tree and altering the Merkle root.

#### **Process**

- To verify `Tx1`:
    - You need `H2` (hash of `Tx2`) and `H34` (hash of the sibling branch).
    - Recompute the hashes up to the Merkle root and compare it with the block header's Merkle root.

### **2. UTXO Sets in Bitcoin: Tracking Spendable Funds**

Bitcoin uses the **Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)** model to track spendable balances efficiently.

#### **How It Works**

1. **Inputs**:
    - Reference previous transaction outputs.
2. **Outputs**:
    - Create new outputs that may become spendable UTXOs.
3. **UTXO Set**:
    - A database of all unspent outputs, much smaller than the full blockchain.

#### **Use Cases**

- **Balance Query**:
    - Your wallet queries the UTXO set to find all spendable outputs linked to your address.
- **Pruned Nodes**:
    - Nodes can discard old transaction history but maintain the UTXO set for validation.

#### **Example**

1. Transaction:
    - Bob receives 1 BTC (output).
2. Bob spends 0.8 BTC to Alice.
    - Input: References Bob's 1 BTC.
    - Outputs: 0.8 BTC to Alice, 0.2 BTC back to Bob as change.
3. UTXO Set Update:
    - Remove Bob’s 1 BTC.
    - Add Alice’s 0.8 BTC and Bob’s 0.2 BTC.

### **3. Ethereum State Trie: Organizing Accounts and Contracts**

Ethereum uses an **account-based model** with a **Merkle-Patricia Trie** to store account and contract data.

#### **Structure**

- A trie organizes key-value pairs (e.g., account addresses → balances) into a hierarchical structure.
- Each node in the trie is hashed, and the root hash (state root) represents the blockchain state.

#### **Use Cases**

1. **Balance Query**:
    - The trie is traversed to locate the account and retrieve its balance.
2. **Smart Contracts**:
    - Storage variables in contracts are also organized in the trie.

#### **Efficiency**

- Only a small part of the trie needs updating or querying at any time.

### **4. Pruned Nodes: Lightweight Participation**

Pruned nodes keep blockchain participation accessible by discarding older data while maintaining functionality.

#### **How They Work**

- Nodes validate all blocks and transactions during synchronization.
- After validation, they keep only the **current state** (e.g., UTXOs or account balances) and discard older data.

#### **Querying Pruned Data**

1. If your wallet asks for an old transaction:
    - The pruned node confirms that the transaction's effects (e.g., balance changes) are reflected in the current state.
2. To fetch full transaction details:
    - Your wallet queries an archival node.

---

### **5. Archival Nodes: Full Blockchain History**

Archival nodes store the entire blockchain history and are critical for:

1. **Historical Analysis**:
    - Exploring old transactions or blocks.
2. **Indexing Services**:
    - Blockchain explorers (e.g., Etherscan) use archival nodes for their databases.

---

### **6. Light Nodes: Efficient and Minimal**

Light nodes store only block headers and rely on full nodes for:

1. **Verifying Transactions**:
    - Using **Merkle proofs** from full nodes.
2. **Querying States**:
    - Full nodes provide the necessary state data for balances or contracts.

### **Diagram Walkthrough**

The diagram represents the process:

1. **Pruned Node**:
    
    - The wallet queries for a transaction (`Tx123`).
    - Pruned node responds: "Data pruned, but current state is consistent."
2. **Archival Node**:
    
    - Wallet queries the archival node for the full details of `Tx123`.
    - Archival node fetches the transaction from its full history.
3. **Wallet Output**:
    
    - Combines results to present the full transaction and balance history.

### **7. Practical Flow for Your Transactions**

Here’s the step-by-step flow if you query your wallet:

1. **Local Cache**:
    - Wallet checks if the transaction is cached locally.
2. **Pruned Node Query**:
    - Queries the connected node for the current state or transaction details.
3. **Fallback to Archival Node**:
    - If the transaction is pruned, the wallet queries an archival node or a blockchain explorer.
4. **Results**:
    - The wallet combines state (balance) and history (transactions) to display.
