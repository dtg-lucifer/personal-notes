# What is SWR

SWR (stale-while-revalidate) is a React hook library for data fetching developed by Vercel. It provides a way to fetch data and cache it in a way that keeps the user interface up-to-date with the latest data, but also allows the app to use cached data for quick responses.

### Key Features of SWR:

1. **Stale-While-Revalidate**: It serves stale data from the cache while revalidating the data in the background, ensuring that the UI is always responsive and data is always fresh.
2. **Automatic Revalidation**: It revalidates data automatically on interval, focus (when the user returns to the tab), and reconnection.
3. **Lightweight and Fast**: It is designed to be lightweight and has minimal setup, making it easy to integrate and use.
4. **Syntax**: 
```jsx
/** 
* @type {string | null} key
* @type {() => {}} fetcher
* @type {Record<string, string | any>} options
*/

const { data, error, isLoading, isValidating, mutate } = useSWR(key, fetcher, options)
```

### Differences Between SWR and React Query:

1. **Philosophy**:
    - **SWR**: Focuses on keeping the UI responsive by serving stale data first and then revalidating in the background.
    - **React Query**: Focuses on caching, synchronizing, and managing server state efficiently. It offers more fine-grained control over caching policies, retries, and background synchronization.
2. **Features**:
    - **SWR**: Simpler API, automatic background revalidation, and a focus on minimal configuration.
    - **React Query**: Richer set of features, including query invalidation, paginated queries, optimistic updates, and more extensive caching mechanisms.
3. **Use Cases**:
	- **SWR**: Ideal for simpler use cases where you want a straightforward way to fetch and cache data with minimal configuration.
	- **React Query**: Better suited for complex applications that require extensive state management, advanced caching strategies, and more control over server state synchronization.

### Pros and Cons of SWR in Next.js:

#### Pros:
1. **Simple and Intuitive**: Easy to set up and use with minimal configuration.
2. **Great for SSR**: Works well with Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities, ensuring that the initial page load is fast and data is fresh.
3. **Automatic Background Revalidation**: Keeps the data up-to-date without requiring manual intervention.

#### Cons:
1. **Less Control**: Offers fewer options for customizing caching policies and background synchronization compared to React Query.
2. **Limited Advanced Features**: Lacks some of the advanced features available in React Query, such as query invalidation and optimistic updates.
3. **Not Always Optimal for Complex State Management**: May not be suitable for applications with complex data-fetching needs and extensive server state management requirements.

### When to Use SWR:

- **Simple Data Fetching**: For straightforward use cases where you need to fetch and cache data with minimal setup.
- **Next.js Integration**: When you need to leverage server-side rendering and automatic background revalidation.
- **Focus on UI Responsiveness**: When keeping the UI responsive and data up-to-date with minimal configuration is a priority.

### When to Use React Query:

- **Complex Data Management**: For applications with complex data-fetching needs and extensive server state management.
- **Advanced Caching Strategies**: When you need fine-grained control over caching policies and synchronization.
- **Optimistic Updates and Query Invalidation**: For features like optimistic updates and advanced query invalidation.

==In summary, SWR and React Query each have their strengths and are suitable for different use cases. SWR is great for simple data fetching with minimal setup, especially in Next.js applications, while React Query offers more advanced features and greater control for complex data management scenarios.==

## Some code Examples 

- **Inside of ==`app/page.js`**==

```jsx
import useSWR from 'swr'; 
import { fetcher } from '../lib/fetcher'; 

export const revalidate = 10; // Next.js 14 feature to set revalidation 

const Home = () => { 
	const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/data', fetcher); 
	
	if (error) return <div>Failed to load</div>; 
	if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>; 
	
	return ( 
		<div> 
			<h1>Data from SWR</h1> 
			<pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre> 
		</div> 
	); 
}; 

export default Home;
```

- **Inside of ==`lib/fetcher.js`**==

```jsx
'use server';

import axios from 'axios';

export const fetcher = async (url) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(url, {
      headers: {
        'Cache-Control': 's-maxage=10, stale-while-revalidate=59',
      },
    });
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    const err = new Error('An error occurred while fetching the data.');
    err.info = error.response ? error.response.data : error.message;
    err.status = error.response ? error.response.status : 500;
    throw err;
  }
};
```

- **Inside of ==`app/api/data/route.js`==**

```jsx
export async function GET(req) {
  const data = { message: 'Hello from SWR!' };

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Cache-Control': 's-maxage=10, stale-while-revalidate=59',
    },
  });
}
```

## Options
