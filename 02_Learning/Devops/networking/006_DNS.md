# What is DNS
Basically DNS stand for Domain Name System. It acts like the internets phonebook. 
When you type a domain name, DNS resolves it to the corresponding IP address, allowing your browser to load the website.

# How this works
1. **DNS Recursor**: Like a librarian, it receives queries from your device (e.g., web browser). It then makes additional requests to satisfy your DNS query.
2. **Root Nameserver**: The first step in translating human-readable domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses. It points to more specific locations.
3. **TLD Nameserver**: Think of it as a specific rack of books (e.g., “.com”). It hosts the last part of a hostname.
4. **Authoritative Nameserver**: Like a dictionary, it translates specific names into their IP addresses.
