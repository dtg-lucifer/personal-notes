# How to make your own network more secure from attacks

There are some ways to isolate some things from the other things inside your network.  Basically there are manily three **Point of failures** at the network security level.

1. Traffic from the outside of your network (internet)
2. Vulnerabilities of your router
3. Traffic or intrusion from devices that are inside your network

###### What we can do

1. For the first type of attack we can take some simple steps such as never sharing the public ip address to anyone, always use a VPN while surfing on the internet
2. For the second part always harden your routers firware with upgrades and changing the default ssid and passwords. Disabling the forwarded ports. Disabling the ping from the WAN
3. For the last and the most vulnerable place you have to buy some professional gear such as managed switches from **CISCO or NetGear or TP Link** or something better or you can buy some better routers and stuffs from **Unify / Ubiquity**. You can set up Client Isolation to isolate the IOT devices to accessing each other onto your network. You can put your known ans trusted devices and the other devices into seperate **VLANs**
4. Other than these you must have the **IDS** and **IPS** into your home network at some point which stands for **Intrusion Detection System** and **Intrusion Prevention System**.
