# What are protocols
In simple words protocols are some standardised rule sets for the internet to share data between computers. It ensures that each data sharing is done by following some particular ruesets. 

There are protocols such as **TCP/IP**, **UDP**, **FTP**, **SMTP**, **HTTP**, **SSH**, **DCHP (Dynamic host configuration protocol)**, **ICMP (Internet control message protocol)**

> In networking, a protocol is a set of rules for formatting and processing data. Network protocols are like a common language for computers. The computers within a network may use vastly different software and hardware; however, the use of protocols **enables them to communicate with each other regardless**.

# Why we do need these types of protocols 
Network protocols are a set of rules that define how devices on a network communicate and exchange information. They act as a common language for devices, ==allowing them to communicate regardless of differences in software, hardware, or internal processes==. Without protocols, the internet would lack the infrastructure it needs to be functional and usable.
