# What is DevOps? Why DevOps?

Basically in the big tech companies when the tech team size increases by a lot therefore a topic comes to manage the whole process of development and deployment, which is **Devops**

**DevOps** is a set of practices and a framework that brings together IT teams to enhance software development outcomes. [The goal is to create a collaborative experience by leveraging different skill sets across multiple disciplines, ultimately improving the quality of the finished product](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-devops/)[1](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-devops/). In essence, DevOps unifies people, processes, and technology to continually provide value to customers. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Development (Dev)**: This phase involves coding, testing, reviewing, and integrating code. DevOps teams innovate rapidly while maintaining quality and stability through automation and continuous integration.
2. **Operations (Ops)**: The Ops phase focuses on deploying applications into production environments consistently and reliably. It also includes configuring the foundational infrastructure.
3. **Collaboration**: DevOps encourages formerly siloed roles (development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security) to coordinate and collaborate. By adopting a DevOps culture, teams respond better to customer needs and achieve business goals faster.

[In summary, DevOps accelerates software delivery, making it more efficient, reliable, and responsive to market demands](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-devops/)[1](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-devops/)[2](https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops). ðŸš€

# Phases of DevOps

The whole concept of **devops** follows some steps defined in the picture.

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ Plan
â”œâ”€â”€ CI (Continuous integration)
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Build
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Test
â”œâ”€â”€ CD (Continuous Development)
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Release
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Deploy
â”œâ”€â”€ Operate
â”œâ”€â”€ Monitor
â”œâ”€â”€ Again Plan

So basically it forms an Infinity loop that is why the logo for the DevOps looks like Infinity

# Three Columns of DevOps

1. ***[[#infrastructure]]***
2. ***[[#automation]]***
3. ***[[#monitoring]]***

### infrastructure
If we need to deliver a software then we would probably need a server to deploy the software and also a database to store the data and other things which rely on some kind of hardware. ***These are called the infrastructure***
### automation
This is to automate the process of making or creating the infrastructure or anything similar to that using the technologies such as **Terraform**.
### monitoring
Keeping track about how our app is working and finding any issues that the app is facing or is it slower than before and all.

# Roadmap to learn DevOps

Free online books - [ahmedamsaleh/Free-DevOps-Books-1: A curated collection of free DevOps related eBooks (github.com)](https://github.com/ahmedamsaleh/Free-DevOps-Books-1/)
```
version control
linux
coding
agile development
operations
docker/kubernetes
ansible
jenkins
monitoring
```

1. ***[[#linux]]**
2. ***[[#networking]]***
3. ***[[#virtualisation]]*** 
4. Programming and Git
5. Cloud Providers (AWS, 30 - 40 services and how they work)
6. ***[[#IAC]]*** (Infrastucture as Code)
7. ***[[#CI/CD]]***
8. ***[[#Containerization]]***
### Linux
- File systems
- Text editors
- Shell scripting
- SSH
- Virualisation
- Package management
- Process and service management
- Practice - How to make a web server, how to setup a database, user and group management, install different different devops tools9 docker, jenkins, terraform)

### Scripting
- Learn any of these languages - Python, bash, go
- Scripting is used for these 
	- Backup automation
	- working with API
	- integration with other devops tools
	- system cleanip automation
	- email notification script
	- software update automation
	- log analysis automatin
	- network diagnosis scriopt 
	- data tranformation automation
	- user account management script

### Advanced GIT
- rebase
- cherry pick
- and many other complex workflows

### Networking
Important topics - IP Addressing, ip protocols TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, networking services - DHCP, DNS, routing and switching basics, authentication and atuthorizations, security best practicesm shift left security, firewalls and networkd security

Full video - https://youtu.be/qiQR5rTSshw?si=ZmYE3Cr5lKQYFhPr
- DNS
- Private subnet
- Advanced topics
- TCP/IP Protocols and ports
- Routing and gateways (NAT)
- CIDR/Subnetting
- Security - DevSecOps
### Virtualisation
- What is virtualisation
- operating systems

### IAC
it stands for **Infrastrucutre as code**. this states the provisioning and managing the infrastrucutre using code.
Prerequisites: ***YAML, JSON***

- How **terraform** works
- Provisioners and providers and resources in **Terraform**
- What is ansible and learn more about that
- ANSIBLE

### CI/CD
- learn pipelines 
- gitlabs, jenkins, circle ci

### Containerization
- Docker
- Kubernetes
