adri finally decide korlo j o supply debe next sem a and ei sem er exam ta debe na so that she could be able to continue her training for the job.
idk whether this is good or bad. idk either j eta kora or thik hoyeche kina, sonama cheyechilo jano adri pore, pora ta continue kore, although supply is not a bad thing but still its a lot for someone's career, i couldn't tell her, i couldn't express that to her. I thought that it might be a setback for her. lets see what awaits for us.....

slowly working on the **decentralised task management** project, not so much as i thought, started to study again blockchain and rust, i will try to convince didi to buy me some books, one on rust and one on argocd, lets see ki hoi....

nothing much more about me though, i hope i will find something to write about myself one day so that after me if someone reads all of these then can find something on me as well...just kidding though, i wont have much over myself to say though.

well papa jonmodin er thik agei chole gelo, i hopes i would get him this time, protibar kauke na kauke daka hoi which i dont like, ebar a keu chilo na, i really would love him to stay and ebar amr exam o nei oi dine, but ki ar kra jabe.....

idk sometimes while i chat with adri, i stop, i try to feel her through her messages, and she thinks that im busy or im just bored.....i dont like that....i dont want her to think like that, i dont know what to do with that.....
