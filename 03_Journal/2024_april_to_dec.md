# Things i learnt
> **Next 15**
> I learnt this when i was at my internship and i learnt this for specifically helping my project snappy notes which was yet incomplete and i dumped that out 

> **Kafka**
> when i was giving the interview for gdg tiu, arnab da asked me about kafka, and that was the only question i couldnt answer to him, other than that i answered every question, althoug i was selected as domain lead but i was a little bit paranoid about that to i learnt it and created a basic demo project on the 3rd day of my tenure and showed him.

> **EDA**
> when i started learning about devops and cloud i got to know about the microservices pattern and the distributed systems architecture, from there i got the idea of system load, how can a system be affected by load, i started learning a little bit of system designs (high level), i started learning about Event drived acrchitecture (EDA) which was the main architecture where event bus and queues like kafka and rabbitmq used.

> **Cloud** 
> after completing the internship i got curious about the cloud deployments so i started to learn devops first and while i was learning devops i also had to learn networking, that was the time when i got into loved to the cloud infra

> **Devops** 
> i started learning devops as i was bored being a full stack dev and i wanted to learn something new which will and may help me in future so i started devops only for th FOMO but after that i got into love of that

> **Automation** 
> although it was a part of devops but it should get a hold of into my journals, mainly about ansible and terraform is this all about

>**Blockchain** 
>which i am still learning at december)

> **AI**
> got some pretty basic idea about machine learning models, **RAG**, and other AI stuffs (not yet started learning because of lack of knowledge in the maths)

> **RUST & GO**
> as part of my devops journey i started learning go lang i fell in love of low level programming and how the world is adopting the WASM for web dev for peak performance while ditching the javascript runtime so i also started learning rust too

# Journal

Basically this is the first ever journal of my life, ig, idk what to say, just wanna start wrapping my life a little bit and organizing things to keep track of.

Idk kibhabe kobe ki holo amr sathe, i lost a lot of people, some of them were good some of them were not that good. i had the first feeling of a heartbreak, i had the first feeling of being lonely in my whole life. but then i also got to know a lot of people, i made some good friends, i met a girl (adrija) which changed a lot of things for me. i dont know how everything happened, but the co incedence of everything binded us together till now, i really hope i can be with her till the end of my life.
