**Summary**: Build a decentralized identity management platform to securely manage user identities and access permissions.

**Frontend**: Next.js with wallet integration (Metamask or WalletConnect).
**Backend**: Rust or Go for high performance.
**Blockchain**:
	Use DID (Decentralized Identifiers) standards and Ethereum or Hyperledger for managing identities.
	Implement Verifiable Credentials (VCs).
**Cloud**: Deploy the backend using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
**DevOps**: Include monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track API performance.
