**Summary**: Build a decentralized task management system where users can create, assign, and manage tasks in a tamper-proof and transparent manner.

**Frontend**: React.js/Next.js for the user interface.
**Backend**: Go or Rust for building a scalable API.
**Blockchain**: Smart contracts using Solidity (Ethereum) for managing tasks and permissions.
**Cloud**: Deploy using Kubernetes, backed by CI/CD pipelines.
**Extras**:
	Integration with Metamask for user authentication.
	Use IPFS to store files related to tasks (e.g., attachments).
	Implement notifications using Web3 libraries.
