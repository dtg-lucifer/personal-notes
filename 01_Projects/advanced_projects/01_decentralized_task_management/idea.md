**Summary**: Build a decentralized task management system where users can create, assign, and manage tasks in a tamper-proof and transparent manner.

**Frontend**: React.js/Next.js for the user interface.
**Backend**: Go or Rust for building a scalable API.
**Blockchain**: Smart contracts using Solidity (Ethereum) for managing tasks and permissions.
**Cloud**: Deploy using Kubernetes, backed by CI/CD pipelines.
**Extras**:
	Integration with Metamask for user authentication.
	Use IPFS to store files related to tasks (e.g., attachments).
	Implement notifications using Web3 libraries.

#### Workflow and How Things Come Together

### **1. Core Workflow**

1. **User Onboarding and Authentication**:
    
    - Users sign up or log in using **Metamask**.
    - Authentication is achieved by signing a challenge message through Metamask, verifying the user’s wallet address without needing traditional credentials.
2. **Task Creation and Assignment**:
    
    - A user creates a task through the frontend.
    - Task metadata (title, description, deadlines, etc.) is sent to the smart contract for storage on the blockchain.
    - Optional attachments are uploaded to **IPFS**, and the resulting CID (Content Identifier) is stored in the smart contract.
3. **Task Management and Updates**:
    
    - Users with appropriate permissions can update the status or modify task details.
    - Updates are submitted as transactions to the smart contract, ensuring tamper-proof task history.
4. **Notifications**:
    
    - Notifications about task updates, assignments, or deadlines are sent using **Web3 libraries** and can be displayed on the frontend.

### **2. Component Breakdown**

#### **Frontend (React.js/Next.js)**

- **Features**:
    
    - **UI Components**: Forms for task creation, dashboards for task management, and assignment panels.
    - **Metamask Integration**: Button to connect wallet and show the current user’s wallet address.
    - **Notifications**: Real-time updates for tasks using event listeners on the smart contract.
- **Implementation**:
    
    - Use `ethers.js` or `web3.js` to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
    - Create APIs or GraphQL queries to fetch task metadata stored on the blockchain.

#### **Backend (Go/Rust)**

- **Features**:
    
    - Serve as a middleman for querying and caching blockchain data for better performance.
    - Manage interactions with **IPFS** (e.g., upload files and retrieve CIDs).
    - Implement analytics or dashboards by aggregating task data.
- **Implementation**:
    
    - Use frameworks like **Echo** (Go) or **Actix** (Rust) for API development.
    - Implement worker processes for task notifications (e.g., polling blockchain events).

#### **Blockchain (Solidity)**

- **Features**:
    
    - Task creation and storage:
```solidity
struct Task {
	uint id;
	address creator;
	string description;
	string ipfsCID;
	bool completed;
}
```
- Permissions:
	- Only the creator or assignee can update task status.
- Event Emission:
	- Emit events on task creation, updates, or status changes for real-time notifications.
- **Implementation**:
    
    - Use **OpenZeppelin** libraries for role management and security.
    - Develop smart contracts, test using **Hardhat**, and deploy to a testnet like Goerli.

#### **Cloud and Infrastructure (Kubernetes)**:

- **Features**:
    
    - Deploy frontend, backend, and notification workers in containers.
    - Set up **CI/CD pipelines** to automate testing and deployment.
- **Implementation**:
    
    - Use tools like **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD.
    - Use **Helm charts** to manage Kubernetes deployments.

#### **IPFS Integration**:

- Attachments or task-related documents are uploaded to IPFS using APIs (e.g., Pinata or Infura).
- Retrieve stored files using CIDs.

#### **Notifications**:

- Listen to blockchain events using Web3 libraries in the backend.
- Use WebSocket connections to push real-time notifications to the frontend.

### **3. Development Workflow**

1. **Set Up Local Environment**:
    
    - Deploy a local Ethereum blockchain using **Ganache** or **Hardhat Network**.
    - Spin up IPFS nodes locally or use a service like **Pinata**.
    - Use Docker Compose to set up the frontend, backend, and notification services.
2. **Smart Contract Development**:
    
    - Write and test smart contracts for task management.
    - Deploy to a testnet after thorough testing.
3. **Frontend Development**:
    
    - Integrate wallet connection and test UI with dummy blockchain interactions.
    - Ensure smooth interactions between the frontend and blockchain.
4. **Backend and IPFS**:
    
    - Build APIs to handle metadata and file uploads.
    - Test IPFS integration thoroughly.
5. **Deployment**:
    
    - Use Kubernetes for scalability.
    - Implement observability using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

### **4. User Flow**

1. **User visits the app** → Connects wallet via Metamask.
2. **User creates a task** → Task is recorded on the blockchain.
3. **Attachments uploaded** → Files stored on IPFS and linked to the task.
4. **Task assigned/updated** → Events emitted for notifications.
5. **Users view tasks** → Fetch task data via blockchain queries.
6. **Completed tasks** → Marked and tracked with immutable history.
