**Summary**: Extend your existing Rust file synchronization tool into a cross-platform application with a web-based admin interface.

**Frontend**: React.js for the web interface to configure sync settings and monitor devices.
**Backend**: Extend the Rust server to handle authentication, logging, and API requests.
**Cloud**: Deploy the server to a Kubernetes cluster.
**Blockchain**:
	Use blockchain for file integrity verification (hashing) across devices.
	Store metadata on-chain for decentralized tracking.
