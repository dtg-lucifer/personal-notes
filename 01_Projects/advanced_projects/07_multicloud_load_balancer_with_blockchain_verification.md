**Summary**: Build a load balancer that operates across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) with blockchain-based logging for auditability.

**Frontend**: A dashboard using React.js for monitoring the load distribution.
**Backend**: Rust or Go for building the load balancer and blockchain integration.
**Blockchain**: Record every request on-chain for transparent load balancing audits.
**DevOps**: Use Kubernetes for managing containers across clouds.
**Cloud**: Implement cloud-agnostic features using Terraform.
